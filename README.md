# Personal Trainer

## Code Institute Mile Stone 1 Project - Static Front End Site

The project brief was to create a static front end project with a minimum of three separate page areas using HTML and CSS while following UX industry conventions. 

<!--Add link to live web page here and show responsive design-->

## Personal-Trainer <!--confirm website URL-->
The website has been created to provide a personal training service to the local and surrounding areas of Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire to keep fit with a personal training plan.

## User Experience (UX)

### Strategy - User Stories
#### Site Owners Goals
+ The main goal is to provide a bespoke training plan to all clients of all ages, no matter their fitness abilities.
+ Allow clients to contact for information and engage with their own training needs.

#### External User Goals
+ As a first time visitor to the site, I want to clearly understand what Personal Trainer offers.
+ I want to be able to know who the Personal Trainer is and what qualifications/experience the trainer is so I know that I am being trained well.
+ Able to do my own research and follow the trainer on social media so I can see feedback/recommendations on the service offered.
+ Able to make the necessary enquiries in how to initalise the training program or find more information and price of the service.

### Scope
In this release, I wanted to include:
+ Header section - this will contain company logo and basic navigations bar.
+ Body section - this will contain:
    + A welcome message with main image
    + 3 main clickable box areas to navigate to the main content of the site, which are:
        + Service offered.
        + Information about the personal trainer.
        + Enquire page which will have a form to complete and show the location.
+ Footer section - this will include social media links for clients to follow the trainer.

### Structure
The layout of the site will have 4 html pages:
+ A home page
+ A services page
+ An about me page
+ An enquire page

The navigational bar would be used to offer links to get to the intended page at one click of a button.  This will enable a consistent look and feel to the user. 

The order of the pages and content is strategically ordered by Services offered > About me > Enquire, as this will allow a user to know what services are offered as the primary page having navigated away from the home page or viewing on smaller devices. 

The personal trainer about me page is next which enables a user to find further information about the trainer before moving onto the enquiry page.

The use of social media links in the footer section of each web page will keep the consistent look and feel of the course.

### Skeleton
I used wireframes to put together a very basic mock-up of the site based on a desktop/tablet and mobile devices.
<!--Link to wireframe to be added-->
The wireframe can be found here.

### Surface

#### Typography 
+ Open Sans is used for main headings, specifically h1 and h2 headings.
+ All other text uses Montserrat font type.
+ The fall back font type is Sans Serif should the imported fonts do not load correctly.

#### Colours
+ Font colour will be predominately white (unless hover over effects for example feature).  The font colour allows the text to stand out against most dark backgrounds.
+ Background colours will be black.

#### Imagery
<!--TO BE CONFIRMED  The large, background hero image is designed to catch the user's attention and make it obvious immediately what the site is all about.-->

## Features
The site features 4 main html pages:
1. A home page which will have a welcome message on page landing.  It will have 3 boxes in the main content to act as site navigation, to the Services offered, About me, Enquire web pages. 
<!--Add screenshoot of the home page-->
2. A page that will outline the Services offered, which is split into 4 sub-categories:
    + Beginner - aimed for people getting into their fitness routines.
    + Intermediate - aimed for people who have either had signed up to the beginner course or wish to challenge their fitness further.
    + Advanced - designed to be more specific training for a specific goal/upcoming event.
    + Group - aimed at providing a training plan for a small group in a public area.
    <!--Add screenshoot of the services offered page-->
3. About me page to provide information about the personal trainer and experience including a welcome video to introduce the trainer.
<!--Add screenshoot of the about me section-->
4. An Enquire page which will allow a user to contact the trainer for information and provide details to contact the client back in order to book a session separately.
<!--Add screenshoot of the enquire form section-->

Each web page will contain a navigational bar which links to each of the 4 web pages.  The footer section will also be consistent for the user experience on each page with social media links. This will enable a user/client to follow the trainer for advice and information they share.
<!--Add screenshoots of the nav and footer sections-->

### Features Left To Implement
Additional features that I would like to include in a future release would be to:
+ Add a booking system for clients to rebook sessions, so they can do this and save the trainer time, which will also help the user experience and repeat business.
+ More information of prices and an ability to accept payments to book sessions (certainly more for regular clients if the service is more generic and not bespoke)
+ Add more online content with pictures/videos of training sessions and perhaps testimonials of regular clients
